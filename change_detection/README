--- object_visualization
	- viewer to show the detection results in reference and current cloud


--- color_histogram
	- compute color histogram correlation of two point clouds (using only hue and saturation from HSV space)


--- scene_differencing_points
	- similar to the PCL method, but returns in addition to the cloud containing the different points, also vectors with 		   corresponding and non-corresponding points


--- plane_object_extraction
	- extracts points from a specific semantic class, cluster them and extract horizontal planes.
	- for each plane create a convex hull and segment points in the polygonal prism
	- filter flying objects
	- returns a vector of PlaneWithObjInd objects (consists of plane indices, avg_z and plane coefficients; and all indices above 		  that plane). Not clustered into separate objects!


--- extract_objects_using_semantics
	- this is a wrapper for plane_object_extraction
	- it also checks if points that are semantically labeled as objects are close to an extracted objects --> merge them
	- returns a vector of PlaneWithObjInd objects


--- local_object_verification
	- points extracted from a plane get clustered (TODO. MOVE THAT)
	- for each object crop the two clouds, align the supporting planes and try to align the object with ICP
	- score = linear weighting of color correspondence and extend of overlap


--- change_detection
	- downsample input clouds for faster computation of semantic segmentation, object extraction from planes and LV
	- filter out objects with similar color to their supporting plane and which are planar (helpfull if reconstruction generates 		  double floors)
	- region growing to  get missed object parts and also to filter out false positives when it becomes too big
	- upsample again to have the results in full resolution (= add points within 1 cm distance). This has the effect that some 		  points at the bottom removed via plane_object_extraction get recovered


My original change detection method detects objects labeled as object from semenatic segmentation and smaller objects that were fused with the supporting plane.

TODO:
main.cpp:532 recomputing normals; exchange that with the normal combination used for ppf now


only part of the objects is detected when it is not fully placed on the plane. e.g at the table edge
